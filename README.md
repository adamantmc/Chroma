A syntax highlighting chrome extension using highlight.js.

The extension is not available on the chrome web store. Instead, you can 
download the Chroma.crx file, and drop it in the extensions menu of Chrome.

If you want to use it without the prepackaged .crx file, you can clone this
repository in some folder, and from the extensions menu, choose "Load unpacked
extension" and select the folder you cloned into.

You can choose the highlighting theme from the popup menu that emerges when
the Chroma icon on the toolbar is clicked.
